#Python-challenge

##Background


Provided with two different excel sheets for PyBank and Pypoll, I started with

creating a new repository for this Python-challenge homework and named it python-challenge.

Cloned the new repository with the computer

Inside the local repository, created a directory for both Python Challenges. Used Resources folder to store the excel sheets for PyBank and Pypoll

Inside the respository created a file called main.py where the python script is been placed. Pushed the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

--------------------------
Analaysis for PyBank:
--------------------------
In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. We were given a financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Out task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Got the results like below

Financial Analysis!

Total Months: 86 Total: $38382578 Average Change: $-2315.12 Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159) Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition, we were asked print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Below is the result for the same!

which is attached in the main folder as output.txt file

Analysis for PyPoll
--------------------------
In this challenge, we were are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

We were given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Got the results like below

Election Results
Total Votes: 3521001
Khan: 63.000% (2218231) Correy: 20.000% (704200) Li: 14.000% (492940) O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)

Idition, to out final script we had to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.Here is the image of the same.

And the same is been place below the Resources folder in github
